# AWK_Parsing

Create a file "users.txt" from the following template on your local machine:

User: | password:
Mikek | ASDF#$%RTFQWF$%SDFA Tom | SDT@#$^%$R)(F)SADF Daniel | LSDJAF(#$)!E!E&! Tessa | KLHJSDF()*&@#$ALCJ@

and create a bash script called "list_pswd.sh" that prints out only the passwords as a list (i.e: ASDF#$%RTFQWF$%SDFA SDT@#$^%$R)(F)SADF LSDJAF(#$)!E!E&! KLHJSDF()*&@#$ALCJ@ )
